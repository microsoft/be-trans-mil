## How to file issues and get help

In general, this project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing
issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates.  For new issues, file your bug or
feature request as a new Issue.

However, this repository is not under active development. It is meant as a documentation repository for the accompanying
paper. Hence, we will likely not accept feature requests or bug reports, except in very rare cases.
